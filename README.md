### What I do
I'm solution engineer in Sysdig. As part of the monitoring team, I'm one of the maintainers of PromCat, a repository of Prometheus exporters, configurations, dashboards and alerts.

### What I did before
In the past, I created a videogame company, worked in a telecom vendor and I was CTO of a monitoring company for energy and smart industry.

### What I do for fun
I like videogames and security. I published an open source online adventures engine: JSCUMM. You can use it to make your own games. 

### You can ask me about...
I've spent the last years in monitoring. You can reach me to talk about statistcs, industrial interfaces, dashboards, Prometheus/Grafana... and even electrical metrics. Also, we can talk about containers and Kubernetes. 

I know some things about sysadmin, security, machine learning, parsers and design.

### While I'm programming...
If I can choose, I like Go for backend, JS for frontend (I'm a clasic) and Python for parsing and scripting. Also Python is my choice for data and text processing.

If possible, I prefer delta blues and sea shanties while programming, but some days clasic rock and irish folk makes my day!
